	abstract = {This paper analyzes the conditions under which consistent estimation can be achieved in instrumental variables (IV) regression when the available instruments are weak and the number of instruments, Kn, goes to inﬁnity with the sample size. We show that consistent estimation depends importantly on the strength of the instruments as measured by rn, the rate of growth of the so-called concentration parameter, and also on Kn. In particular, when Kn → ∞, the concentration parameter can grow, even if each individual instrument is only weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, and consistency of certain estimators can be established under weaker conditions than have previously been assumed in the literature. Hence, the use of many weak instruments may actually improve the performance of certain point estimators. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator an√d the bias-corrected two-stage least squares (B2SLS) estimator are consistent when Kn/rn → 0 while the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator is consistent only if Kn/rn → 0 as n → ∞. These consistency results suggest that LIML and B2SLS are more robust to instrument weakness than 2SLS.},

This finding is established using US branching deregulations between 1994 and 2005 as instruments for credit. Credit increases for deregulated banks, but not in placebo samples. Such differential responses rule out demand-based explanations, and identify an exogenous credit supply shock. Because of geographic diver-sification, treated banks expand credit: housing demand increases, house prices rise, but to a lesser extent in areas with elastic housing supply, where the housing stock increases instead. In an instrumental variable sense, house prices are well explained by the credit expansion induced by deregulation. (JEL G21, G28, R21, R31)},

Building on Bierens (1982), we ﬁrst propose an Integrated Conditional Moment (ICM) type statistic constructed by setting the parameters to the value under the null hypothesis. The ICM procedure tests at the same time the value of the coeﬃcient and the speciﬁcation of the model. We then adopt the conditionality principle used by Moreira (2003) to condition on a set of ICM statistics that informs on identiﬁcation strength. Our two procedures uniformly control size irrespective of identiﬁcation strength. They are powerful irrespective of the nonlinear form of the link between instruments and endogenous variables and are competitive with existing procedures in simulations and applications.},

Therefore, the test is consistent against all deviations from the parametric model. The test is robust to heteroskedasticity. A version of the test can be constructed which will have asymptotic power equal to 1 against any local alternatives approaching the null at rates slower than the parametric rate 1/,/{\textasciitilde}.

This paper investigates the Instrumental Variables (IV) version of this problem. The resulting population parameter is called the Optimal Linear IV Approximation (OLIVA). This paper shows that a necessary condition for regular identiﬁcation of the OLIVA is also suﬃcient for existence of an IV estimand in a linear IV model. The necessary condition holds for the important case of a binary endogenous treatment, leading also to a LATE interpretation with positive weights. The instrument in the IV estimand is unknown and is estimated in a ﬁrst step. A Two-Step IV (TSIV) estimator is proposed. We establish the asymptotic normality of a debiased TSIV estimator based on locally robust moments. The TSIV estimator does not require neither completeness nor identiﬁcation of the instrument. As a by-product of our analysis, we robustify the classical Hausman test for exogeneity against misspeciﬁcation of the linear model. Monte Carlo simulations suggest excellent ﬁnite sample performance for the proposed inferences.},

	abstract = {We consider instrumental variables regression in models where the number of available instruments may be larger than the sample size and consistent model selection in the first stage may not be possible. Such a situation may arise when there are many weak instruments. With many weak instruments, existing approaches to first-stage regularization can lead to a large bias relative to standard errors. We propose a jackknife instrumental variables estimator (JIVE) with regularization at each jackknife iteration that helps alleviate this bias. We derive the limiting behavior for a ridge-regularized JIV estimator (RJIVE), verifying that the RJIVE is consistent and asymptotically normal under conditions which allow for more instruments than observations and do not require consistent model selection. We provide simulation results that demonstrate the proposed RJIVE performs favorably in terms of size of tests and risk properties relative to other many-weak instrument estimation strategies in high-dimensional settings. We also apply the RJIVE to the Angrist and Krueger (1991) example where it performs favorably relative to other manyinstrument robust procedures.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing honest conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for a scalar parameter of interest, such as the regression discontinuity parameter, in nonparametric regression based on kernel or local polynomial estimators. To ensure that our CIs are honest, we derive novel critical values that take into account the possible bias of the estimator upon which the CIs are based. We show that this approach leads to CIs that are more eﬃcient than conventional CIs that achieve coverage by undersmoothing or subtracting an estimate of the bias. We give sharp eﬃciency bounds of using diﬀerent kernels, and derive the optimal bandwidth for constructing honest CIs. We show that using the bandwidth that minimizes the maximum mean-squared error results in CIs that are nearly eﬃcient and that in this case, the critical value depends only on the rate of convergence. For the common case in which the rate of convergence is n−2/5, the appropriate critical value for 95\% CIs is 2.18, rather than the usual 1.96 critical value. We illustrate our results in a Monte Carlo analysis and an empirical application.},

            We propose a semiparametric test for the value of coefficients in models with conditional moment restrictions that has correct size regardless of identification strength. The test is in essence an Anderson-Rubin (AR) test using nonparametrically estimated instruments to which we apply a standard error correction. We show that the test is (1) always size-correct, (2) consistent when identification is not too weak, and (3) asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible AR test when identification is sufficiently strong. We moreover prove that under homoskedasticity and strong identification our test has a limiting noncentral chi-square distribution under a sequence of local alternatives, where the noncentrality parameter is given by a quadratic form of the inverse of the semiparametric efficiency bound.},

The behavior of the K statistic can be spurious around inﬂection points and maxima of the objective function. This inadequacy is overcome by combining the K statistic with a statistic that tests the validity of the moment equations and by an extension of Moreira’s (2003) conditional likelihood ratio statistic toward GMM. We conduct a power comparison to test for the risk aversion parameter in a stochastic discount factor model and construct its conﬁdence set for observed consumption growth and asset return series.},

A select set of three classes of applications is discussed in more detail. The second part of the paper shows how one can verify a key property called stochastic equicontinuity. The paper takes several stochastic equicontinuity results from the probability literature, which rely on entropy conditions of one sort or another, and provides primitive sufficient conditions under which the entropy conditions hold. This yields stochastic equicontinuityresults that are readily applicable in a variety of contexts. Examples are provided.},

	abstract = {We propose a simple data-driven procedure that exploits heterogeneity in the ﬁrst stage correlation between an instrument and an endogenous variable to improve the eﬃciency of instrumental variable estimators. Eﬃciency improvements are important in the context of instrumental variable estimation because inferential procedures that are robust to weak instruments often generate uninformative conﬁdence intervals in empirical applications. Our procedure either reduces the length of the conﬁdence intervals for the second stage parameters or reduces the probability of producing unbounded conﬁdence intervals. We show that the resulting eﬃciency gains can be quite large in settings where there is substantial heterogeneity in the ﬁrst-stage parameters. We also show that a naive procedure used in some applied work, which consists of selecting the composition of the sample based on the value of the ﬁrst-stage F -statistic, produces inconsistent estimators and may cause substantial over-rejection of a null hypothesis on a second stage parameter. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed method has excellent small sample performance. Finally, we apply the methods to study the return to compulsory schooling using census data in the United States. We demonstrate that our proposed method substantially tighten the conﬁdence intervals of the return to compulsory education parameter, often from unbounded intervals generated by the classic Anderson-Rubin test to informative intervals.},

Both tests are very fast to compute. The paper shows that the tests have correct asymptotic size and are asymptotically similar (in a uniform sense) under very weak conditions. For example, in i.i.d. scenarios, all that is required is that the moment functions and their derivatives have 2 + bounded moments for some {\textgreater} 0: No conditions are placed on the expected Jacobian of the moment functions, on the eigenvalues of the variance matrix of the moment functions, or on the eigenvalues of the expected outer product of the (vectorized) orthogonalized sample Jacobian of the moment functions. The SR-CQLR test is shown to be asymptotically e¢ cient in a GMM sense under strong and semi-strong identi…cation (for all k p; where k and p are the numbers of moment conditions and parameters, respectively). The SR-CQLR test reduces asymptotically to Moreira’s CLR test when p = 1 in the homoskedastic linear IV model. The same is true for p 2 in most, but not all, identi…cation scenarios. We also introduce versions of the SR-CQLR and SR-AR tests for subvector hypotheses and show that they have correct asymptotic size under the assumption that the parameters not under test are strongly identi…ed.

A general asymptotic integrated mean-square error approximation is obtained and used to derive an optimal plug-in tuning parameter selector. A uniform Bahadur representation is developed for linear functionals of the estimator. Using this representation, asymptotic normality is established, along with consistency of a standard-error estimator.

	abstract = {This paper studies a classical problem in statistical decision theory: a hypothesis test of a sharp null in the presence of a nuisance parameter. The main contribution of this paper is a characterization of two ﬁnite-sample properties often deemed reasonable in this environment: admissibility and similarity. Admissibility means that a test cannot be improved uniformly over the parameter space. Similarity requires the null rejection probability to be unaﬀected by the nuisance parameter. The characterization result has two parts. The ﬁrst part—established by Chernozhukov, Hansen, and Jansson (2009)—states that maximizing Weighted average power (WAP) subject to a similarity constraint suﬃces to generate admissible, similar tests. The second part—hereby established—states that constrained WAP maximization is (essentially) a necessary condition for a test to be admissible and similar. The characterization result shows that choosing an admissible, similar test is tantamount to selecting a particular weight function to report weighted average power. This result applies to full vector inference with a nuisance parameter, not to subvector inference. The paper also revisits the theory of testing in the instrumental variables model. Speciﬁcally—and in light of the relevance of the weighted average power criterion in the main theoretical result—the paper suggests a weight function for the structural parameters of the homoskedastic instrumental variables model, based on the priors proposed by Chamberlain (2007). The corresponding test is, by construction, admissible and similar. In addition, the test is shown to have ﬁnite- and large-sample properties comparable to those of the conditional likelihood ratio test.},

	abstract = {This paper considers two-sided tests for the parameter of an endogenous variable in an instrumental variable (IV) model with heteroskedastic and autocorrelated errors. We develop the finite-sample theory of weighted-average power (WAP) tests with normal errors and a known long-run variance. We introduce two weights which are invariant to orthogonal transformations of the instruments; e.g., changing the order in which the instruments appear. While tests using the MM1 weight can be severely biased, optimal tests based on the MM2 weight are naturally two-sided when errors are homoskedastic. We propose two boundary conditions that yield two-sided tests whether errors are homoskedastic or not. The locally unbiased (LU) condition is related to the power around the null hypothesis and is a weaker requirement than unbiasedness. The strongly unbiased (SU) condition is more restrictive than LU, but the associated WAP tests are easier to implement. Several tests are SU in finite samples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the Anderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I. Andrews' (2015) PI-CLC tests) and two-sided tests which are optimal when the sample size is large and instruments are strong. We refer to the WAP-SU tests based on our weights as MM1-SU and MM2-SU tests. Dropping the restrictive assumptions of normality and known variance, the theory is shown to remain valid at the cost of asymptotic approximations. The MM2-SU test is optimal under the strong IV asymptotics, and outperforms other existing tests under the weak IV asymptotics.},

Contrary to popular belief, we show there exist model symmetries when equation errors are heteroskedastic and autocorrelated (HAC). Our theory is consistent with existing results for the homoskedastic model (Andrews, Moreira and Stock(2006\vphantom{\{}\} and Chamberlain (2007\vphantom{\{}\}), but in general uses information on the structural parameter beyond the Anderson-Rubin, score, and rank statistics. This suggests that tests based only the Anderson-Rubin and score statistics discard information on the causal parameter of interest. We apply our theory to construct designs in which these tests indeed have power arbitrarily close to size. Other tests, including other adaptations to the CLR test, do not suffer the same deficiencies. Finally, we use the model symmetries to propose novel weighted-average power tests for the HAC-IV model.},

	abstract = {This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for GMM estimators and test statistics when some or all of the parameters are weakly identiﬁed. General results are obtained and are specialized to two important cases: linear instrumental variables regression and Euler equations estimation of the CCAPM. Numerical results for the CCAPM demonstrate that weak-identiﬁcation asymptotics explains the breakdown of conventional GMM procedures documented in previous Monte Carlo studies. Conﬁdence sets immune to weak identiﬁcation are proposed. We use these results to inform an empirical investigation of various CCAPM speciﬁcations; the substantive conclusions reached differ from those obtained using conventional methods.},

The rationale for focusing on nonlinear models is that, if the dependent variable is binary or limited, or if the e ect of the treatment varies with covariates, a nonlinear model is appropriate. In the spirit of Roehrig (Econometrica 56 (1988) 433), identiÿcation is attained nonparametrically and does not depend on the choice of the parametric speciÿcation for the response function of interest. One virtue of this approach is that it allows the researcher to construct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-deÿned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeciÿcation. In contrast to some usual IV models, heterogeneity of treatment e ects is not restricted by the identiÿcation conditions. The ideas and estimators in this article are illustrated using IV to estimate the e ects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings.},

We propose a method of estimating the mean function nonparametrically under the assumption that it is smooth. We suggest a variant on the usual form of cross-validation for choosing the degree of smoothing to be employed. This method of cross-validation, which consists of deleting entire sample curves, has the advantage that it does not require that the covariance structure be known or estimated. In the estimation of the covariance structure, we are primarily concerned with models in which the first few eigenfunctions are smooth and the eigenvalues decay rapidly, so that the variability is predominantly of large scale. We propose smooth nonparametric estimates of the eigenfunctions and a suitable method of cross-validation to determine the amount of smoothing. Our methods are applied to data on the gaits of a group of 5-year-old children.},

A large literature in econometrics develops procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust conﬁdence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for non-homoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use instrumental variables. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

	abstract = {Consider testing the null hypothesis that a single structural equation has speciﬁed coeﬃcients. The alternative hypothesis is that the relevant part of the reduced form matrix has proper rank, that is, that the equation is identiﬁed. The usual linear model with normal disturbances is invariant with respect to linear transformations of the endogenous and of the exogenous variables. When the disturbance covariance matrix is known, it can be set to the identity, and the invariance of the endogenous variables is with respect to orthogonal transformations. The likelihood ratio test is invariant with respect to these transformations and is the best invariant test. Furthermore it is admissible in the class of all tests. Any other test has lower power and/or higher signiﬁcance level. In particular, this likelihood ratio test dominates a test based on the Two-Stage Least Squares estimator.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the conditions under which consistent estimation can be achieved in instrumental variables (IV) regression when the available instruments are weak and the number of instruments, Kn, goes to inﬁnity with the sample size. We show that consistent estimation depends importantly on the strength of the instruments as measured by rn, the rate of growth of the so-called concentration parameter, and also on Kn. In particular, when Kn → ∞, the concentration parameter can grow, even if each individual instrument is only weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, and consistency of certain estimators can be established under weaker conditions than have previously been assumed in the literature. Hence, the use of many weak instruments may actually improve the performance of certain point estimators. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator an√d the bias-corrected two-stage least squares (B2SLS) estimator are consistent when Kn/rn → 0 while the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator is consistent only if Kn/rn → 0 as n → ∞. These consistency results suggest that LIML and B2SLS are more robust to instrument weakness than 2SLS.},

Because of geographic diver-sification, treated banks expand credit: housing demand increases, house prices rise, but to a lesser extent in areas with elastic housing supply, where the housing stock increases instead. In an instrumental variable sense, house prices are well explained by the credit expansion induced by deregulation. (JEL G21, G28, R21, R31)},

The ICM procedure tests at the same time the value of the coeﬃcient and the speciﬁcation of the model. We then adopt the conditionality principle used by Moreira (2003) to condition on a set of ICM statistics that informs on identiﬁcation strength. Our two procedures uniformly control size irrespective of identiﬁcation strength. They are powerful irrespective of the nonlinear form of the link between instruments and endogenous variables and are competitive with existing procedures in simulations and applications.},

The necessary condition holds for the important case of a binary endogenous treatment, leading also to a LATE interpretation with positive weights. The instrument in the IV estimand is unknown and is estimated in a ﬁrst step. A Two-Step IV (TSIV) estimator is proposed. We establish the asymptotic normality of a debiased TSIV estimator based on locally robust moments. The TSIV estimator does not require neither completeness nor identiﬁcation of the instrument.

A score test and a variant of the Anderson-Rubin test are shown to be members of the class. When identiﬁcation is strong, the power surface for the score test is generally close to the power envelope for the class of similar tests. However, when identiﬁcation is weak, the score test no longer has power close to the envelope. Dropping the restrictive assumptions of normality and known covariance matrix, the results are shown to remain valid in large samples even in the presence of weak instruments.},

Such a situation may arise when there are many weak instruments. With many weak instruments, existing approaches to first-stage regularization can lead to a large bias relative to standard errors. We propose a jackknife instrumental variables estimator (JIVE) with regularization at each jackknife iteration that helps alleviate this bias. We derive the limiting behavior for a ridge-regularized JIV estimator (RJIVE), verifying that the RJIVE is consistent and asymptotically normal under conditions which allow for more instruments than observations and do not require consistent model selection. We provide simulation results that demonstrate the proposed RJIVE performs favorably in terms of size of tests and risk properties relative to other many-weak instrument estimation strategies in high-dimensional settings. We also apply the RJIVE to the Angrist and Krueger (1991) example where it performs favorably relative to other manyinstrument robust procedures.},

To ensure that our CIs are honest, we derive novel critical values that take into account the possible bias of the estimator upon which the CIs are based. We show that this approach leads to CIs that are more eﬃcient than conventional CIs that achieve coverage by undersmoothing or subtracting an estimate of the bias. We give sharp eﬃciency bounds of using diﬀerent kernels, and derive the optimal bandwidth for constructing honest CIs. We show that using the bandwidth that minimizes the maximum mean-squared error results in CIs that are nearly eﬃcient and that in this case, the critical value depends only on the rate of convergence. For the common case in which the rate of convergence is n−2/5, the appropriate critical value for 95\% CIs is 2.18, rather than the usual 1.96 critical value. We illustrate our results in a Monte Carlo analysis and an empirical application.},

            We propose a semiparametric test for the value of coefficients in models with conditional moment restrictions that has correct size regardless of identification strength. The test is in essence an Anderson-Rubin (AR) test using nonparametrically estimated instruments to which we apply a standard error correction. We show that the test is (1) always size-correct, (2) consistent when identification is not too weak, and (3) asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible AR test when identification is sufficiently strong. We moreover prove that under homoskedasticity and strong identification our test has a limiting noncentral chi-square distribution under a sequence of local alternatives, where the noncentrality parameter is given by a quadratic form of the inverse of the semiparametric efficiency bound.},

Its asymptotic χ2 distribution therefore holds under a wider set of circumstances, like weak instruments, than the standard full rank case for the expected Jacobian under which the asymptotic χ2 distributions of the traditional statistics are valid. The behavior of the K statistic can be spurious around inﬂection points and maxima of the objective function. This inadequacy is overcome by combining the K statistic with a statistic that tests the validity of the moment equations and by an extension of Moreira’s (2003) conditional likelihood ratio statistic toward GMM. We conduct a power comparison to test for the risk aversion parameter in a stochastic discount factor model and construct its conﬁdence set for observed consumption growth and asset return series.},

A select set of three classes of applications is discussed in more detail. The second part of the paper shows how one can verify a key property called stochastic equicontinuity. The paper takes several stochastic equicontinuity results from the probability literature, which rely on entropy conditions of one sort or another, and provides primitive sufficient conditions under which the entropy conditions hold.

	abstract = {We propose a simple data-driven procedure that exploits heterogeneity in the ﬁrst stage correlation between an instrument and an endogenous variable to improve the eﬃciency of instrumental variable estimators. Eﬃciency improvements are important in the context of instrumental variable estimation because inferential procedures that are robust to weak instruments often generate uninformative conﬁdence intervals in empirical applications. Our procedure either reduces the length of the conﬁdence intervals for the second stage parameters or reduces the probability of producing unbounded conﬁdence intervals. We show that the resulting eﬃciency gains can be quite large in settings where there is substantial heterogeneity in the ﬁrst-stage parameters. We also show that a naive procedure used in some applied work, which consists of selecting the composition of the sample based on the value of the ﬁrst-stage F -statistic, produces inconsistent estimators and may cause substantial over-rejection of a null hypothesis on a second stage parameter. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed method has excellent small sample performance. Finally, we apply the methods to study the return to compulsory schooling using census data in the United States. We demonstrate that our proposed method substantially tighten the conﬁdence intervals of the return to compulsory education parameter, often from unbounded intervals generated by the classic Anderson-Rubin test to informative intervals.},

Both tests are very fast to compute. The paper shows that the tests have correct asymptotic size and are asymptotically similar (in a uniform sense) under very weak conditions. For example, in i.i.d. scenarios, all that is required is that the moment functions and their derivatives have 2 + bounded moments for some {\textgreater} 0: No conditions are placed on the expected Jacobian of the moment functions, on the eigenvalues of the variance matrix of the moment functions, or on the eigenvalues of the expected outer product of the (vectorized) orthogonalized sample Jacobian of the moment functions. The SR-CQLR test is shown to be asymptotically e¢ cient in a GMM sense under strong and semi-strong identi…cation (for all k p; where k and p are the numbers of moment conditions and parameters, respectively). The SR-CQLR test reduces asymptotically to Moreira’s CLR test when p = 1 in the homoskedastic linear IV model. The same is true for p 2 in most, but not all, identi…cation scenarios. We also introduce versions of the SR-CQLR and SR-AR tests for subvector hypotheses and show that they have correct asymptotic size under the assumption that the parameters not under test are strongly identi…ed.

Identification strength is directly defined through the conditional moments that flatten as the sample size increases. Our new minimum distance estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal, robust to semi-strong identification, and does not rely on the choice of a user-chosen parameter, such as the number of instruments or some smoothing parameter. Heteroskedasticity-robust inference is possible through Wald testing without prior knowledge of the identification pattern. Simulations show that our estimator is competitive with alternative estimators based on many instruments, being well-centered with better coverage rates for confidence intervals.},

The uniform rate explicitly accounts for the effect of moment assumptions, which is useful in semiparametric inference. A general asymptotic integrated mean-square error approximation is obtained and used to derive an optimal plug-in tuning parameter selector. A uniform Bahadur representation is developed for linear functionals of the estimator. Using this representation, asymptotic normality is established, along with consistency of a standard-error estimator. The finite-sample performance of the partitioning estimator is examined and compared to other nonparametric techniques in an extensive simulation study.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a classical problem in statistical decision theory: a hypothesis test of a sharp null in the presence of a nuisance parameter. The main contribution of this paper is a characterization of two ﬁnite-sample properties often deemed reasonable in this environment: admissibility and similarity. Admissibility means that a test cannot be improved uniformly over the parameter space. Similarity requires the null rejection probability to be unaﬀected by the nuisance parameter. The characterization result has two parts. The ﬁrst part—established by Chernozhukov, Hansen, and Jansson (2009)—states that maximizing Weighted average power (WAP) subject to a similarity constraint suﬃces to generate admissible, similar tests. The second part—hereby established—states that constrained WAP maximization is (essentially) a necessary condition for a test to be admissible and similar. The characterization result shows that choosing an admissible, similar test is tantamount to selecting a particular weight function to report weighted average power. This result applies to full vector inference with a nuisance parameter, not to subvector inference. The paper also revisits the theory of testing in the instrumental variables model. Speciﬁcally—and in light of the relevance of the weighted average power criterion in the main theoretical result—the paper suggests a weight function for the structural parameters of the homoskedastic instrumental variables model, based on the priors proposed by Chamberlain (2007). The corresponding test is, by construction, admissible and similar. In addition, the test is shown to have ﬁnite- and large-sample properties comparable to those of the conditional likelihood ratio test.},

	abstract = {This paper considers two-sided tests for the parameter of an endogenous variable in an instrumental variable (IV) model with heteroskedastic and autocorrelated errors. We develop the finite-sample theory of weighted-average power (WAP) tests with normal errors and a known long-run variance. We introduce two weights which are invariant to orthogonal transformations of the instruments; e.g., changing the order in which the instruments appear. While tests using the MM1 weight can be severely biased, optimal tests based on the MM2 weight are naturally two-sided when errors are homoskedastic. We propose two boundary conditions that yield two-sided tests whether errors are homoskedastic or not. The locally unbiased (LU) condition is related to the power around the null hypothesis and is a weaker requirement than unbiasedness. The strongly unbiased (SU) condition is more restrictive than LU, but the associated WAP tests are easier to implement. Several tests are SU in finite samples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the Anderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I. Andrews' (2015) PI-CLC tests) and two-sided tests which are optimal when the sample size is large and instruments are strong. We refer to the WAP-SU tests based on our weights as MM1-SU and MM2-SU tests. Dropping the restrictive assumptions of normality and known variance, the theory is shown to remain valid at the cost of asymptotic approximations. The MM2-SU test is optimal under the strong IV asymptotics, and outperforms other existing tests under the weak IV asymptotics.},

Contrary to popular belief, we show there exist model symmetries when equation errors are heteroskedastic and autocorrelated (HAC). Our theory is consistent with existing results for the homoskedastic model (Andrews, Moreira and Stock(2006\vphantom{\{}\} and Chamberlain (2007\vphantom{\{}\}), but in general uses information on the structural parameter beyond the Anderson-Rubin, score, and rank statistics. This suggests that tests based only the Anderson-Rubin and score statistics discard information on the causal parameter of interest. We apply our theory to construct designs in which these tests indeed have power arbitrarily close to size. Other tests, including other adaptations to the CLR test, do not suffer the same deficiencies. Finally, we use the model symmetries to propose novel weighted-average power tests for the HAC-IV model.},

	abstract = {This article investigates model checks for a class of possibly nonlinear heteroskedastic time series models, including but not restricted to ARMA-GARCH models. We propose omnibus tests based on functionals of certain weighted standardized residual empirical processes. The new tests are asymptotically distribution-free, suitable when the conditioning set is infinite-dimensional, and consistent against a class of Pitman’s local alternatives converging at the parametric rate

              the sample size. A Monte Carlo study shows that the simulated level of the proposed tests is close to the asymptotic level already for moderate sample sizes and that tests have a satisfactory power performance. Finally, we illustrate our methodology with an application to the well-known S\&P 500 daily stock index. The paper also contains an asymptotic uniform expansion for weighted residual empirical processes when initial conditions are considered, a result of independent interest.},

Full descriptions of possible forms of the CLR, Anderson–Rubin (AR) and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) confidence sets are given. I show that the CLR confidence sets have nearly the shortest expected arc length among similar symmetric invariant confidence sets in a circular model.

Numerical results for the CCAPM demonstrate that weak-identiﬁcation asymptotics explains the breakdown of conventional GMM procedures documented in previous Monte Carlo studies. Conﬁdence sets immune to weak identiﬁcation are proposed. We use these results to inform an empirical investigation of various CCAPM speciﬁcations; the substantive conclusions reached differ from those obtained using conventional methods.},

The rationale for focusing on nonlinear models is that, if the dependent variable is binary or limited, or if the e ect of the treatment varies with covariates, a nonlinear model is appropriate. In the spirit of Roehrig (Econometrica 56 (1988) 433), identiÿcation is attained nonparametrically and does not depend on the choice of the parametric speciÿcation for the response function of interest. One virtue of this approach is that it allows the researcher to construct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-deÿned approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspeciÿcation. In contrast to some usual IV models, heterogeneity of treatment e ects is not restricted by the identiÿcation conditions. The ideas and estimators in this article are illustrated using IV to estimate the e ects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings.},

We propose a method of estimating the mean function nonparametrically under the assumption that it is smooth. We suggest a variant on the usual form of cross-validation for choosing the degree of smoothing to be employed. This method of cross-validation, which consists of deleting entire sample curves, has the advantage that it does not require that the covariance structure be known or estimated. In the estimation of the covariance structure, we are primarily concerned with models in which the first few eigenfunctions are smooth and the eigenvalues decay rapidly, so that the variability is predominantly of large scale. We propose smooth nonparametric estimates of the eigenfunctions and a suitable method of cross-validation to determine the amount of smoothing. Our methods are applied to data on the gaits of a group of 5-year-old children.},

	title = {Weak {Instruments} in {IV} {Regression}: {Theory} and {Practice}},
	abstract = {When instruments are weakly correlated with endogenous regressors, conventional methods for instrumental variables estimation and inference become unreliable. A large literature in econometrics develops procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust conﬁdence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for non-homoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use instrumental variables. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

	abstract = {Consider testing the null hypothesis that a single structural equation has speciﬁed coeﬃcients. The alternative hypothesis is that the relevant part of the reduced form matrix has proper rank, that is, that the equation is identiﬁed. The usual linear model with normal disturbances is invariant with respect to linear transformations of the endogenous and of the exogenous variables. When the disturbance covariance matrix is known, it can be set to the identity, and the invariance of the endogenous variables is with respect to orthogonal transformations. The likelihood ratio test is invariant with respect to these transformations and is the best invariant test. Furthermore it is admissible in the class of all tests. Any other test has lower power and/or higher signiﬁcance level. In particular, this likelihood ratio test dominates a test based on the Two-Stage Least Squares estimator.},

	abstract = {We propose a wild bootstrap procedure for linear regression models estimated by instrumental variables. Like other bootstrap procedures that we have proposed elsewhere, it uses eﬃcient estimates of the reduced-form equation(s). Unlike them, it takes account of possible heteroskedasticity of unknown form. We apply this procedure to t tests, including heteroskedasticity-robust t tests, and to the Anderson-Rubin test. We provide simulation evidence that it works far better than older methods, such as the pairs bootstrap. We also show how to obtain reliable conﬁdence intervals by inverting bootstrap tests. An empirical example illustrates the utility of these procedures.},
