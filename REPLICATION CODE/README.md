# Note on replication files

The source code containing all the functions used for the simulations and application is in `functions.R`. The files allow to replicate the simulation exercise and the application code and more, but without the format used in the working paper. The original data for the application is freely available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ENLGZX.
